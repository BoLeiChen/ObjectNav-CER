# Abstract
The object goal navigation task requires the agent to navigate through a previously unknown environment using spatial and semantic contextual information, where the goal is usually specified by a semantic label (e.g., find a TV). Such a navigation task is especially challenging as it requires formulating and understanding the complex co-occurrence relations among objects in diverse settings, which is critical for long-sequence navigation decision-making. Existing methods learn to either explicitly represent semantic priors as discrete relationships, or implicitly encode them from raw and rough observations, thus can not benefit from the rich environmental semantics. In this work, we propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based ObjectNav framework that learns to actively imagine spatial and semantic clues outside the agent's field of view and further mine Continuous Environmental Representations (CER) using self-supervised learning. We verify that our approach combining map-based imagination and CER facilitates the learning of complicated semantic priors and navigation skills. Additionally, the illusion of spatial and semantic patterns allows the agent to perform Multi-Step Forward-Looking Planning (MSFLP) by considering the temporal evolution of egocentric local observations. Our approach is thoroughly evaluated and ablated in the visually realistic environments of the Matterport3D (MP3D) dataset. The experimental results reflect that our approach incorporating CER and foresight planning achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ObjectNav task. In addition, adequate quantitative and qualitative analyses validate the excellent generalization ability and superiority of our method.
